=== Index APIs changes

==== Closing / deleting indices while running snapshot

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, closing or deleting an index during a
full snapshot would make the snapshot fail. In 5.0, the close/delete index
request will fail instead. The behavior for partial snapshots remains
unchanged: Closing or deleting an index during a partial snapshot is still
possible. The snapshot result is then marked as partial.

==== Warmers

Thanks to several changes like doc values by default and disk-based norms,
warmers are no longer useful. As a consequence, warmers and the warmer API
have been removed: it is no longer possible to register queries that will run
before a new IndexSearcher is published.

Don't worry if you have warmers defined on your indices, they will simply be
ignored when upgrading to 5.0.

==== System CPU stats

The recent CPU usage (as a percent) has been added to the OS stats
reported under the node stats API and the cat nodes API. The breaking
change here is that there is a new object in the `os` object in the node
stats response. This object is called `cpu` and includes `percent` and
`load_average` as fields. This moves the `load_average` field that was
previously a top-level field in the `os` object to the `cpu` object. The
format of the `load_average` field has changed to an object with fields
`1m`, `5m`, and `15m` representing the one-minute, five-minute and
fifteen-minute loads respectively. If any of these fields are not present,
it indicates that the corresponding value is not available.

In the cat nodes API response, the `cpu` field is output by default. The
previous `load` field has been removed and is replaced by `load_1m`,
`load_5m`, and `load_15m` which represent the one-minute, five-minute
and fifteen-minute loads respectively. The field will be null if the
corresponding value is not available.

Finally, the API for `org.elasticsearch.monitor.os.OsStats` has
changed. The `getLoadAverage` method has been removed. The value for
this can now be obtained from `OsStats.Cpu#getLoadAverage` but it is no
longer a double and is instead an object encapsulating the one-minute,
five-minute and fifteen-minute load averages. Additionally, the recent
CPU usage can be obtained from `OsStats.Cpu#getPercent`.

==== Suggest stats

Suggest stats exposed through `suggest` in indices stats has been merged
with `search` stats. `suggest` stats is exposed as part of `search` stats.

==== Creating indices starting with '-' or '+'

Elasticsearch no longer allows indices to be created started with '-' or '+', so
that the multi-index matching and expansion is not confused. It was previously
possible (but a really bad idea) to create indices starting with a hyphen or
plus sign. Any index already existing with these preceding characters will
continue to work normally.

==== Aliases API

The `/_aliases` API no longer supports `indexRouting` and `index-routing`, only
`index_routing`. It also no longer support `searchRouting` and `search-routing`,
only `search_routing`. These were removed because they were untested and we
prefer there to be only one (obvious) way to do things like this.

==== OpType Create without an ID

As of 5.0 indexing a document with `op_type=create` without specifying an ID is not
supported anymore.

==== Flush API

The `wait_if_ongoing` flag default has changed to `true` causing `_flush` calls to wait and block
if another flush operation is currently running on the same shard. In turn, if `wait_if_ongoing` is set to
`false` and another flush operation is already running the flush is skipped and the shards flush call will return
immediately without any error. In previous versions `flush_not_allowed` exceptions where reported for each skipped shard.
