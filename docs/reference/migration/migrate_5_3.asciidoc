=== Packaging changes

[float]
==== Logging configuration

Previously Elasticsearch exposed a single system property (`es.logs`) that
included the absolute path to the configured logs directory, and the prefix of
the filenames used for the various logging files (the main log file, the
deprecation log, and the slow logs). This property has been replaced in favor of
three properties:

 * `es.logs.base_path`: the absolute path to the configured logs directory
 * `es.logs.cluster_name`: the default prefix of the filenames used for the
   various logging files
 * `es.logs.node_name`: exposed if `node.name` is configured for inclusion in
   the filenames of the various logging files (if you prefer)

The property `es.logs` is deprecated and will be removed in Elasticsearch 6.0.0.

[float]
==== Use of Netty 3 is deprecated

Usage of Netty 3 for transport (`transport.type=netty3`) or HTTP
(`http.type=netty3`) is deprecated and will be removed in Elasticsearch
6.0.0.
